The only authorized mass market edition of the twentieth-century classic, featuring F. Scott Fitzgerald’s final revisions, a foreword by his granddaughter, and a new introduction by National Book Award winner Jesmyn Ward.

This edition of The Great Gatsby has been updated by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar James L.W. West III to include the author’s final revisions and features a note on the composition and text, a personal foreword by Fitzgerald’s granddaughter, Eleanor Lanahan—and an introduction by two-time National Book Award winner Jesmyn Ward.

The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald’s third book, stands as the supreme achievement of his career.

The story of the mysteriously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his love for the beautiful Daisy Buchanan is an exquisitely crafted tale of America in the 1920s.
