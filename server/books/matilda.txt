Matilda

--------------------------------------------------



Matilda, Roald Dahl

 

Matilda didn't have much luck with her parents.

Her father is a criminal, and a mother, a nagging woman and not exactly intelligent. The two believe that Matilda is a real nuisance that wastes too much time with reading instead of watching TV, like normal people... Nor does the terrific lady Trunchbull, the headmistress of the school, have a better opinion of the little read pass. But Matilda isn't quite the only one. Miss Honey, her teacher, knows that the little girl is a genius and that she hides a few aces on her sleeve.

Why read it:

A Book for Children Who Feel Dissatisfied With Adults

A reminder of human potential and how to change it if you have the right attitude

Imagination is an inexhaustible resource, as are books

Matilda, who taught you to read? She asked.
I actually learned Miss Honey.
And did you read a book alone? I'm talking about children's books, of course.
“Yes, Miss Honey, I read all the books in the library on the Great Street.
