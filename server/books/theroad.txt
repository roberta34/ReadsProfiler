The Road

--------------------------------------------------

A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the devastated landscape except the ashes in the wind. It's so cold as to break the rocks, and the falling snow is grey. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coastal area, although they don't know what awaits them there, if there's anything there. They have nothing; just a gun to defend themselves against the ungodly gangs that are trouting the road, the clothes they wear, a stroller of food found — and one another.

A father and his son walk through alone burns America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold to fasting stones, and when the snow falls is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, they don't know what, if anything, awaits there. They have nothing; just a gun to defend against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes are they wear, a cart of scavenged food—and other each.
