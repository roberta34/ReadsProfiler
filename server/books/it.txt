MAGNIFIES THE ODYSSE OF THE TERROR AT THE MASTER OF THE GENRE HORROR. ROMANIAN SCREENED BY WARNER BROS IN 2017.

Derry, from Maine, is a city of provincial frightening people familiar to anyone, but really frightening things are happening here.

Seven teenagers were directly confronted with these things. And now he has to come back and keep his promise made 28 years ago: to catch the creature that once again hunts the children of the city. Their horrific memories of summer when everything has changed will help them hunt the monster masked in the clown that lures with balloons, chestnuts and pretzels.

“The world of children is prolonged in an empire of fear, for absolute evil, without names, can only be defeated by love and friendship. A novel that depicts another dimension of fear, but also a magnificent story of friendship. King wrote a masterpiece.”
