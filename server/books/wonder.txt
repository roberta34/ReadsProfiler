Wonder

--------------------------------------------------

My name is August. I wont describe to you what I look like. Whatever youre thinking, its probably worse.

Ten-year-old Auggie just wants to be ordinary, but he was born with a terrible facial abnormality. Now hes attending school for the first time. Can he convince his classmates that hes just like them?

Frank, funny and moving, WONDER is a novel youll remember long after the final page.
