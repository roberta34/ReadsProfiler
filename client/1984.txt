1984

--------------------------------------------------

1984 is a classic dystopian novel by English author George Orwell.

Published in 1949, it is set in the eponymous year and focuses on a repressive, totalitarian regime.

The story follows the life of one seemingly insignificant man, Winston Smith, a civil servant assigned the task of falsifying records and political literature, thus effectively perpetuating propaganda, who grows disillusioned with his meager existence and so begins an ultimately futile rebellion against the system.

The novel has become famous for its portrayal of surveillance and society's increasing encroachment on the rights of the individual. Since its publication the terms Big Brother and Orwellian have entered the popular vernacular.
